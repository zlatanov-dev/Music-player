Try it out! - https://music-player-z.github.io/

This project is a simple music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player allows users to play, pause, skip to the previous or next track, and view the progress of the currently playing track.
Getting Started

To use the Music Player, simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser. The player comes pre-loaded with a few songs, but you can easily add your own songs by modifying the music.js file.
Usage

Once the player is loaded, you can use the following controls:

    Play/Pause: Click the play/pause button to start or stop the currently playing track.
    Previous/Next: Click the previous/next buttons to skip to the previous or next track.
    Progress bar: Drag the progress bar to skip to a specific point in the currently playing track.
